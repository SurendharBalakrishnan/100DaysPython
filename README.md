# 100DaysPython
As a Senior Web Developer, I already have hands-on experience with multiple languages and frameworks.
But instead of skipping the fundamentals, I'm intentionally starting from the basics of Python â€” to build rock-solid consistency and sharpen my problem-solving mindset from the ground up.

This is not just about learning syntax. Itâ€™s about:

Building the habit of daily deep work ðŸ§ 

Practicing deliberate problem-solving ðŸ§©

Preparing for LeetCode, data challenges, and real-world AI/ML use cases

Iâ€™ll be sharing my daily learnings publicly, pushing code to GitHub, and tracking my growth over the next 100 days and beyond.
